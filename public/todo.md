Need to organize CSS better, follow SMACCS. Right now layout has almost all of the styling for how things look (color, font), it is supposed to just be the structure of the page. I want to completely restructure my CSS, build them from the ground up now that I know the general layout that I want.

Need to make it look better on desktop. Right now everything is designed for mobile (1 column) but I would like to have it display differently for desktop having two columns to show the projects as well as making the sizing more appropriate for a larger screen.

Add actual image and description of myself to replace the placeholder and lorem ipsum text.
